title: DGA reporting month page iteration
date: 2026-03-10
---

We previously [designed a page to view the DGA reporting month](/manage-cases/reporting-on-cases-that-failed-dga/).

We've iterated the page as part of a wider redesign of DGA reporting.

## What we changed

### Removed status tags from police forces

The previous design showed a status tag next to each police unit. They were:

- Not started
- In progress
- Completed

We removed the tags because they were unnecessary.

The state of each unit is already clear from the content below the heading — either a count of outstanding cases with a button, or a confirmation that all outcomes have been recorded.

### Replaced status tags with specific counts and actions

For police forces with outcomes still to record, the page now shows exactly how many cases need attention and a "Record dispute outcomes" button.

The button links to the case list, pre-filtered to show only that police force's cases with outstanding DGA outcomes. This is a significant change from the previous design, which linked to a dedicated DGA case list embedded within the reporting hub. Reusing the case list means users work in a consistent way.

For police forces where all outcomes have been recorded, the page shows inset text confirming the count - for example, "Outcomes have been recorded for all 26 cases." - with a link to view those cases in the filtered case list.

![The February 2026 month view. The deadline is shown at the top: "Outcomes must be recorded by 10 April 2026 at 11:59pm." Metropolitan Police shows 37 cases needing outcomes with a "Record dispute outcomes" button. Thames Valley Police shows 2 cases needing outcomes with a "Record dispute outcomes" button. West Midlands Police shows an inset: "Outcomes have been recorded for all 26 cases. View cases that failed DGA."](/manage-cases/dga-reporting-month-page-iteration/month-with-outstanding-outcomes.png)

### Added a deadline passed state

When the deadline for a month has passed, the page now reflects this clearly.

The heading area shows when the deadline passed - for example, "The deadline for recording outcomes passed on 11 January 2026 at 11:59pm."

For units where outcomes were not recorded before the deadline, an inset shows how many cases were missed - for example, "Outcomes were not recorded for 10 out of 10 cases before the deadline." - alongside a link to view those cases.

Units that completed recording before the deadline continue to show the completion confirmation.

![The November 2025 month view. The deadline passed message reads: "The deadline for recording outcomes passed on 11 January 2026 at 11:59pm."

Thames Valley Police shows an inset: "Outcomes were not recorded for 10 out of 10 cases before the deadline.
